This UD3 is based off of a topic that I personally really enjoy and like. Reading is a hobby of mines, and so when I was talking about a topic to make a project on, my teacher recommended a personal bookshelf/library. This is how UD3 was made. This coding project is a personal bookshelf that takes in all the books the user read, and saves them. It allows users to categorize their books into "Completed", "Uncompleted", and "All." I make use of classes and methods to contribute to the UD. My project is user input based. I also make use of the labs that I did in this class, and got a lot of help from them, and used similar coding from them in my UD3. Overall, this topic was very fun to do, as I can use this myself as my own bookshelf to help me keep track of the books I read, and how I felt about them.
